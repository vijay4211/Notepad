Code:
const filterCategory = (items, selectedCategory) => {
  if (selectedCategory === "all") return items;
  return items.filter((item) => item.category === selectedCategory);
};

Explain Above Code:
âœ… Explanation:
ðŸ“Œ const filterCategory = (items, selectedCategory) => { ... }
Declares an arrow function named filterCategory.

It takes 2 parameters:

items: an array of product objects.

selectedCategory: the current selected filter (like "Electronics", "Fashion", or "all").


ðŸ“Œ if (selectedCategory === "all") return items;
If the selected category is "all", it means the user wants to see all products, not filtered.

So it directly returns the full items array without filtering.


ðŸ“Œ return items.filter((item) => item.category === selectedCategory);
If a specific category is selected (like "Electronics"), this line filters the products.

.filter() goes through each product (item) and keeps only those where item.category matches selectedCategory.



ðŸ“¦ Example in Action:
js
Copy
Edit
items = [
  { name: "Laptop", category: "Electronics" },
  { name: "T-shirt", category: "Fashion" }
];

selectedCategory = "Electronics";

Result â†’ filterCategory(items, "Electronics")
â†’ [
  { name: "Laptop", category: "Electronics" }
]


âœ… Summary:
This function is used to dynamically filter products based on the selected category.
It uses simple logic:

If user selects "all" â†’ return everything

Otherwise â†’ return only matching category

Let me know if you'd like a version that filters by multiple conditions (like category + price
